# Algorithm-Adams_Bashforth
Algorithm of Adams_Bahforth with equation y' = x + y -1.

Declaration :
Adams_Bashforth(m, x, y, yn, h)

"m" is steps;
"x" array of values on domain;
"y" array of values on image;
"yn" is the last value on fuction;
"h" is range between x_n and x_(n+1);


This method only calculates the Adams-Bashforth method.
